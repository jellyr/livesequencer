example usage:

timidity -iA &
./live-sequencer stream.hs &
aconnect Mode TiMidity &

this should give you an ongoing stream
of notes

then change one of the numbers 
that appear in the lines like
"mid = note 64 300"

this should immediately have an effect
(change pitch and duration of some
of the notes)
